              No two people are the same. Nonetheless, this uniqueness is what makes us human. In human-centered design, these quirks are what we unite to create a sense of belongingness and an atmosphere of inclusivity. In this talk, we will
              discuss one of the founding pillars of user experience design which is designing for everyone because one size does not simply fit all without the proper considerations.

                Today’s society is highly proactive when it comes to making a difference. However, when using design-thinking to create a human-centric experience, we first think of the human. Since the human’s behavior greatly affects the culture
                of the society, designing for the human will definitely result in a bigger social impact. In this talk, we encourage you to start small and design for one, but think big and think for others.

                Innovation is what makes modern society run. With the influx of production of new technology, it gets harder and harder to stand out in the market and create something that could make a difference in how we live our lives. In this talk, we will discuss design-thinking as a success formula towards innovation.
